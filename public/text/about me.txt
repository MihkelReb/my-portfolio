          <h2>Hey, I'm Mihkel Rebane.</h2>
          <p>Thrilled to toss my hat into the ring for the Junior Developer role at Veikkaus Suite. As a web developer in the making, I've danced with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React, and I'm itching to bring my dynamic approach and collaborative spirit to your innovative team.</p>
          <p>I've always had this itch to understand how things work, a fascination with technology, and an insatiable curiosity for learning new tidbits. It's what keeps me hooked and eager to dive into the world of coding.</p>
          <p>For me, problem-solving is a step-by-step journey. First, it's about identifying the problem, then digging into its roots, and finally, experimenting with potential fixes until things click.</p>
          <p>When I'm not in front of a screen, you'll find me diving into a pool for a swim, competing in video games (I have a soft spot for shooters and racing games), or dreaming about hitting the mountain-bike trails. I'm also a fan of esports, with a particular fondness for League and counter-strike, and I never miss a Formula 1 race.</p>
          <p>As a team member, I'm all about support—whether it's offering a helping hand or creating a positive and light team environment. I'm a bit of a shy introvert initially, but once I warm up, I contribute to that good mood that makes teamwork thrive.</p>
          <p>My motivation? It's a self-improvement journey fueled by a constant interest in new things. I'm captivated by the unknown and strive to be a skilled and sought-after developer without specific long-term goals, except to keep evolving in this dynamic field.</p>
          <p>I took a deep dive into a custom React API project, utilizing ChatGPT extensively. Hands-on experimentation is my go-to learning method. I work most effectively with a structured environment and short-term goals, but I'm not afraid to dream big—it just takes a bit more definition.</p>
          <p>I have a knack for working hard, maybe too hard. Burnout has taught me the importance of balancing dedication to work with self-care. All-nighters near deadlines? Been there, done that.</p>
          <p>"Practice doesn't make perfect; perfect practice makes perfect." And the idea that keeping expectations low can soften the blow of failure and make success even sweeter. As for the mantra of "Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better."—I'm working on living that truthfully, overcoming the fear of failure and bouncing back stronger.</p>
          <p>The Junior Developer role at Veikkaus grabbed my attention, sparking the creation of this portfolio. React, highlighted in the job description, led me to delve deeper, initiating a tutorial, crafting a Tic-Tac-Toe game (also having worked on a spontaneous API project using React in spring 2023). I'm eager to bring my skills, enthusiasm, and problem-solving mindset to your team, contributing to innovative projects in a dynamic and supportive environment that aligns with my passion for continuous learning.</p>
